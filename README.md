This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script,  run_analysis.R , does the following:
1.Download the dataset and unzip the content.
2.Load the training and test datasets and combine them.
3.Load the test and traning activity and combine them.
4.load the test and training subject and combined them.
5.Load Feature dataset and use it as new variable column names.
6.Merge 2,3 and 4 and keep only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation variables.
7.Clean the variable names so as to be as descriptive as possible.
8.Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt
